### Golang
__For the last 2 years I'm passionate about golang__.
To improve my skills I entered a tution where I developed a lot of projects:
* [CLI for quering csv file with SQL statements](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_best_final) which included:
  *  [simple SQL-parser](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_best_final/blob/master/pkg/sqlparser/service.go)
  *  [Table console writer](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_best_final/blob/master/pkg/consolewriter/consolewriter.go)
* [URL shortener](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final) [🌐](https://shrtnergb.herokuapp.com/web/generate) which includedes :
  * [Open API specs](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/blob/master/api/api.yml)
  * [Postgres as storage](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/tree/master/storage)
  * [Echo as router](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/blob/master/cmd/shrtener/app/api.go)
  * [Frontend written in JavaScript](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/tree/master/web)
* Other Small projects to learn different piece of technology:

   * Console approval
   * Redis as a storage

### Python Era
__While diving into Python I developed:__
* [Interactive schedule board](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/schedulesite) for school students of Volgograd region of Russia (still in use in couple schools there)
* [Telegram bot for the school schedule](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/schedulebot) for students with the same API as interactive board
* A year ago I developed a system to apply for entry exams in one of Moscow schools (project is private and still in use)
