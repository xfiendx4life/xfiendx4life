### Golang
__Since 2020 I've been passionate about golang__.
To apply to different companies I made a number of test assignments these are a few of them:
* [This one made me lucky to find my first developer position](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/pony_test) this is a MQTT information parser.
* [The second one brought me to the interview, but...](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/media_tel_test) this one is an API to work with social graph

To improve my skills I entered a tution where I made a number of projects:
* [CLI for quering csv file with SQL statements](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_best_final) which included:
  *  [simple SQL-parser](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_best_final/blob/master/pkg/sqlparser/service.go)
  *  [Table console writer](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_best_final/blob/master/pkg/consolewriter/consolewriter.go)
* [URL shortener](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final) [üåê](https://shrtnergb.herokuapp.com/web/generate) which included:
  * [Open API specs](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/blob/master/api/api.yml)
  * [Postgres as storage](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/tree/master/storage)
  * [Echo as router](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/blob/master/cmd/shrtener/app/api.go)
  * [Frontend written in JavaScript](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_go_backend_final/tree/master/web)
* Other Small projects to learn different tools:
  * [Small REST and gRPC service](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_back_2_hw/tree/rest/hw9) to work with items lists
  * [Service to approve registration via sms or email](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/gb_back_2_hw/tree/rest/hw6)
    * Console approval
    * Redis as a storage

### Python Era
__While diving into Python I made:__
* [Interactive schedule board](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/schedulesite) for school students in Volgograd region, Russia (still in use in couple schools there)
* [Telegram bot for the school schedule](https://github.com/xfiendx4life/schedulebot) with the same API used in the interactive board project ‚òùÔ∏è
* A system to apply for entry exams in one of Moscow schools (project is private and still in use)
